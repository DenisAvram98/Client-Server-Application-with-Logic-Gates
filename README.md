**Application description:**
A client-server application that allows the client to design logic circuits using logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) and obtain the output result from the server (C# + MindFusion Windows Forms Diagramming)

For running this app first you need to change the connection IP address in both Client and Server with your local IP address.

    string IpAdress = "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx";
    
First run the Server application and then the Client application.\
This client-server application was made to run on localhost.
